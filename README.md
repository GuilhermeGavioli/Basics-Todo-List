# Reflection

> What was the context for this project? 

The main goal with every Basics project is to take a step back by not using any framework such as react, next js or vue, but only using Vanilla Js.
- Practicing DOM Manipulation.
- Practicing LocalStorage.
- Learn better ways of doing old things.

> Why was this project challenging and a good learning experience?

Some good learnings were:
- Remember old concepts such as:
* Working with localStorage.
* Working with DOM manipulation.
